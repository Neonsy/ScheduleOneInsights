## üí° Motivation

I've recently discovered [Schedule One](https://www.scheduleonegame.com) and have come to enjoy the unique combination of silliness and casual relaxation, alongside the product management aspects and efficiency optimization.

While there is an existing [calculator website](https://schedule1-calculator.com), I wanted to create a more comprehensive experience with modern solutions.
This project aims to enhance the gameplay experience in multiple dimensions.

> [!WARNING]
> This project may cause extreme optimization satisfaction and potentially addictive gameplay sessions!
