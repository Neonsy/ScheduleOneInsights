### Roadmap Phases & Key Focus Areas

Development for ScheduleOneInsights is structured into distinct phases, each dedicated to implementing core capabilities and expanding functionality.
While the nature of open-source development means timelines can be flexible, these phases represent the current strategic priorities and themes guiding the project's evolution.

#### Phase 1: Foundational Core & Library Development

*   **Focus:** Building a robust and accurate simulation library (`schedule1lib`) that serves as the project's backend.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Achieve precise modeling of substance interactions based on game mechanics.
    *   Establish comprehensive unit testing to ensure calculation accuracy and reliability.
    *   Develop a modular and scalable architecture to facilitate future expansion and adaptation.
*   **Significance:** A solid and accurate foundation is essential for all subsequent features and tools built upon the library.

#### Phase 2: Initial User-Facing Web Interface

*   **Focus:** Translating the library's power into an accessible and intuitive web application.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Implement the fundamental **Drag-and-Drop Mixing** interface for visual recipe construction.
    *   Introduce core **"What-If" Reverse Mixing** capabilities for exploring desired outcomes.
    *   Create an initial presentation layer for basic **Targeted NPC Insights**.
    *   Lay the groundwork for an **Actionable Game Guide**.
    *   Provide a multi-session-calculator, to allow you to keep track of different quantities.
*   **Impact:** Provides users with interactive tools to immediately leverage the project's capabilities.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Community Ecosystem

*   **Focus:** Enhancing existing tools with greater depth and fostering a platform for community knowledge sharing.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Expand **Reverse Mixing** with more sophisticated criteria, filters, and analysis options.
    *   Grow the **Actionable Game Guide** to include advanced strategies and optimization techniques.
    *   Develop features to support a **Community-Driven Meta**, enabling sharing, and rating of mix strategies.
*   **Benefit:** Unlocks deeper strategic possibilities and facilitates learning from collective community expertise.

#### Phase 4: Refinement, Adaptation & Future Exploration

*   **Focus:** Continuous improvement based on user feedback, adapting to game updates, and exploring new horizons.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Ongoing performance optimization and user experience refinements.
    *   Integration of community-suggested features and improvements.
    *   Ensuring the project remains current and compatible with updates to the base game.
*   **Outlook:** ScheduleOneInsights is designed to be an evolving resource, growing alongside the game and its player base.
