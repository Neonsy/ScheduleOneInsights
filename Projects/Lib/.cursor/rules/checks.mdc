# Code Quality Checks

## Required Checks

Execute the following checks frequently. Address any reported errors or warnings before proceeding.

    *   **Purpose:** Checks for TypeScript compiler errors (`tsc`).
    *   **Requirement:** Must pass with no errors.
2.  **`pnpm lint`**
    *   **Purpose:** Runs ESLint to check for code style and potential logical errors.
    *   **Requirement:** Must pass with no errors or warnings (configured to fail on warnings).
3.  **`pnpm test`**
    *   **Purpose:** Runs unit and integration tests (using Vitest).
    *   **Requirement:** All tests must pass.
4.  **`pnpm build`**
    *   **Purpose:** Compiles the TypeScript project for production.
    *   **Requirement:** Must compile successfully with no errors.
