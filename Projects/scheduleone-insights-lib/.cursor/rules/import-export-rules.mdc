mirroring
Make sure that the export dir mirros the rest of the lib dir. However, only folders and filenames that are being exported should be mirrored.

alias paths
Always use "@" alias for local project imports and exports.

use-barrel-files
Add an index.ts barrel in each feature root to re-export public modules. That should be done in the exports directory. Barrel index files can use wildcard exports, as the non index files take care of explicitly exporting.

ensure-exports-up-to-date
Ensure when creating or modifying code that exports are up to date.
