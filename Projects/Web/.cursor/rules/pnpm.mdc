# PNPM Usage Rules

## Commands

*   **Use `pnpm`:** ALWAYS use `pnpm` for Node.js package management tasks (install, add, remove dependencies) and running scripts defined in `package.json`. Do not use `npm` or `yarn`.

## Lockfile Maintenance

*   **Update Lockfile:** After adding or removing dependencies using `pnpm add` or `pnpm remove`, ALWAYS run `pnpm install` immediately afterward to ensure `pnpm-lock.yaml` is updated and consistent.
