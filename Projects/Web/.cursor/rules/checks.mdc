# Code Quality Checks

## Required Checks

Execute the following checks frequently. Address any reported errors or warnings before proceeding.

1.  **`pnpm format`**
    *   **Purpose:** Formats all files for consistency.
    *   **Requirement:** Must pass with no errors.
2.  **`pnpm typecheck`**
    *   **Purpose:** Runs TypeScript type checking to catch type errors and ensure type safety.
    *   **Requirement:** Must pass with no errors.
3.  **`pnpm lint`**
    *   **Purpose:** Runs ESLint to check for code style and potential logical errors.
    *   **Requirement:** Must pass with no errors or warnings (configured to fail on warnings).
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Only fix ESLint errors and warnings if the user explicitly tells you to. Do not auto-fix or suppress errors/warnings unless requested.
